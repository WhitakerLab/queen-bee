## Goals and motivations


## Materials required

* [Title slide](#title-slide) above to be shown on the big screen at the beginning while you're talking
* An [online timer](#online-timer) to be shown on the big screen while people are taking part in the ice breaker
* A [microphone](#microphone) so you can be heard over the chatter
* A [buzzer](#buzzer) or alarm that you can use to signal moving to the next activity

### Title slide

The title slide can be downloaded either as a powerpoint file if you'd like to edit it or a jpg image if you're happy with the standard form.

* Download `pptx` [here](https://github.com/WhitakerLab/queen-bee/raw/master/QueenBeeInstructions.pptx)
* Download `jpg` [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/WhitakerLab/queen-bee/master/QueenBeeInstructions.jpg) (you need to right click and save the image from the browser to your computer)

### Online timer

A good online timer can be found at http://e.ggtimer.com.

* Open 3 tabs in your browser for [1 minute](https://e.ggtimer.com/1minutes), [3 minutes](https://e.ggtimer.com/3minutes) and [2 minutes](https://e.ggtimer.com/3minutes).
* When you need to switch to the next activity, just move to the appropriate tab and then click refresh to start the timer.

Don't worry too much about being exactly on time, its ok to click refresh after you've finished speaking for example, but do try to move the conversations along quickly.
In the best case scenario it will be difficult to break up interesting conversations.
That's the goal!
You want to leave people feeling like they want to find those people again, later in the day, to chat more.

:construction: *This timer could be improved by also showing the instruction along with the time on the screen.* :construction: <br>
:construction: *I (Kirstie) haven't found a good website that does this, but any suggestions are very welcome!* :construction: 

### Microphone

Hopefully there will be a lot of *buzz* (geddit?) in the room as people are having interesting conversations so it's really important that the facilitator can be heard easily.

### Buzzer

In order to get everyone's attention, it is useful to have a buzzer to indicate that the time is up and that everyone should move to the next activity.

You could either buy a loud buzzer or fog horn, or set up an alarm on your phone and hold that phone up to the microphone when it needs to be heard.

## Script

*This is a sample script that you can use as inspiration for what to say when you're facilitating a queen bee ice breaker.*
*Please edit as much as you'd like to make it sound like your voice!*

*The words in **bold** are those that could be emphasised for each sentence.*

*The example below is recommended for a data study group at the Turing Institute so it focuses on a group who are coming together for a week and who are interested in data science.*
*The relevant parts of the script below should be changed if you're running - for example - a one day session on open science.*

> **Good morning everyone!**
>
> One of the goals of this week is to get to know each other.
> So we're going to do a little ice breaker!
>
> (Yep! A cheesy cheesy ice breaker!)
>
> It's called the **Queen Bee** and the instructions are up here on the screen.
>
> When I finish speaking (not now!) you're going to get into groups of **three**.
>
> When you're in those groups give each other a number: 1, 2, 3.
>
> (Easy so far, right?)
>
> You're going to take it in turns (number 1 first, number 2 second etc) being the **Queen Bee** of your little hive.
>
> When you're all together in your group, the Queen bee has **1 minute** to ask a question.
>
> Then, the worker bees from all of the groups **go buzzing around the room** to find answers to the Queen's question.
> The bees have **3 minutes** to get the answers.
>
> (The queen doesn't just stand around while the worker bees are finding her answers!
> She can go and **answer other queen's questions**!)
>
> Remember that the point of this game is to **meet each other** so don't just chat with the first person you meet.
> Go and ask the same question of as many people as you can in those 3 minutes!
>
> At the end of the 3 minutes of buzzing around the room, the hive have **2 minutes** to get back together and share back the answers they learned.
> Hopefully they're all interesting!
> 
> At the end of those 2 minutes, the Queen Bee switches to the next person and we start from the beginning again.
> (1 minute to ask a question, 3 minutes to find answers in the room, 2 minutes to share back what the hive learned.)
>
> So, the big question you're all wondering is **what sorts of questions should I ask**??
>
> The answer is kinda, **whatever you'd like to ask**!
>
> Probably having something data science related makes sense, but isn't required.
> Maybe "How do I run this particular deep learning analysis?"
> Or "How do I get a job as a data scientist in industry?"
> Or "How do I finish this darned PhD?!?"
>
> One of the questions that I think a lot about is **"How do we get a diverse group of people working together on a brand new project quickly and effectively when we only have a few days to deliver a result?"**
> I think it's really tough to work collaboratively together so that everyone feels that they're contributing to the success of the team.
>
> So if you want to ask questions about **building a team** that would be pretty fun in my opinion!
>
> But just to reiterate, all questions are welcome!
>
> Ok, **that's enough of me talking!**
> Go and get into your groups.
> Give everyone a number 1, 2, 3, and I'll start the timer for the first queen bee to ask her question.

The Queen Bee idea was proposed by [Lauren Cadwallader](https://osc.cam.ac.uk/osc-team-contacts/professional-activities-osc-staff/lauren-cadwallader) for [OpenCon Cambridge in 2017](https://www.opencon2018.org/opencon_2017_cambridge).

This repository was developed from that idea by [Kirstie Whitaker](https://whitakerlab.github.io/about) for the Alan Turing Institute [Data Study Group](https://www.turing.ac.uk/collaborate-turing/data-study-groups) team in 2018.

### Sharing your changes back

If you make any improvements to the ice breaker instructions, please let Kirstie know as she'd love to be able to add those enhancements to this project repository (with acknowledgement!)

You can [open an issue](https://github.com/WhitakerLab/queen-bee/issues) in this github repository or email her on [kwhitaker@turing.ac.uk](mailto:kwhitaker@turing.ac.uk).

Thank you!
